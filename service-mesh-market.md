<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Service Mesh Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traditional Centralized Agency</li><li>Client Embedded Agent</li><li>Host Independent Process Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the service mesh market, three primary types exist. The Traditional Centralized Agency model relies on a central control plane for managing service interactions, providing a unified view and governance. The Client Embedded Agent approach integrates lightweight proxies directly into client applications, enabling localized control and efficient communication. Lastly, the Host Independent Process Agent model employs independent agents that operate outside the application, managing service communications centrally without being tied to specific hosts, thus enhancing flexibility and scalability in distributed environments.</p></p>
