<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horticultural Grow Lights Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Toplighting</li><li>Interlighting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The horticultural grow lights market is primarily divided into two types: toplighting and interlighting. Toplighting involves placing lights above the plants, providing uniform illumination across the canopy and promoting overall growth. This method is ideal for larger setups and helps in maximizing light penetration. Interlighting, on the other hand, involves placing lights among the plants themselves, targeting lower foliage. This technique enhances light absorption in denser canopies and improves yield by ensuring all parts of the plant receive adequate light.</p></p>
