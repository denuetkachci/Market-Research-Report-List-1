<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Rooftop Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid Type</li><li>Off- Grid Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar rooftop market is categorized into two main types: on-grid and off-grid systems. On-grid systems are connected to the utility grid, allowing users to sell excess energy back to the grid and relying on it for backup. They typically have lower installation costs but depend on external electricity sources. Off-grid systems operate independently, using battery storage to supply power, making them ideal for remote areas without grid access. These systems provide energy security but involve higher initial investments.</p></p>
